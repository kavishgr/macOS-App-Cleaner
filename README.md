# macOS-App-Cleaner

The script was originally written by [sunknudsen](https://github.com/sunknudsen), but his repo is now [archived](https://github.com/sunknudsen/privacy-guides/tree/master/how-to-clean-uninstall-macos-apps-using-appcleaner-open-source-alternative). I didn't want to fork the entire thing, so I only took the app cleaner script to make my own changes.
